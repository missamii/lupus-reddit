I also have fibromyalgia and rheumatoid arthritis among other things.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;People have been urging me to see a lyme literate doctor because all of my lyme disease tests from the hospital have come back negative. They only do one simple test, I guess, and over the past four years I&amp;#39;ve always told them that I&amp;#39;ve never come into contact with a tick. About a week ago, my dad decided to speak up for the first time in 4 years of medical testing and asked my mom if she remembered the time he burnt a tick off of me in Boston when I was 5. We couldn&amp;#39;t believe that I&amp;#39;ve gone this whole time telling doctors that there is no possible way I have lyme disease since I&amp;#39;d never been in contact with a tick.. haha. I have also been sick, as in had a very weak immune system, since the age of 5. Consistently. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t know if I trust Lyme Literate doctors... I&amp;#39;m very skeptical of nontraditional doctors and don&amp;#39;t like that other doctors look to Lyme Literate people as scammers. There&amp;#39;s really no one who can &amp;quot;check&amp;quot; their work to make sure that the patient really DOES have lyme, because no one else reads the tests like they do. You can become lyme literate by attending seminars and researching lyme..... but to me, that does not mean enough. I am sick of seeing doctors who hand me prescription bottles and misdiagnose me with something so that they get paid. The doctor that I am considering seeing has her patients diagnosed with lyme do a holistic treatment with vitamins, minerals, salt baths, infrared saunas, IV hydration therapy ... all things that would make anybody feel better, not just someone with lyme. I think it would make people who have whatever disease it is feel A LOT better, but it doesn&amp;#39;t prove that they had lyme, you know?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m just really skeptical about this and would hate to cling to some diagnosis that isn&amp;#39;t true. As someone who has been sick for most of my life, being an advocate for illness awareness is a big part of my identity. But it&amp;#39;s pretty frustrating when you don&amp;#39;t even know if your doctor just told you that it was that disease for a paycheck.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I also am uncomfortable with the fact that a Lyme Literate doctor diagnosing me with Lyme, then me being unable to add that to my official record at the hospital/with my insurance. It&amp;#39;ll be a quack diagnosis. I just feel really weird about it. Anyone have experience? &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",

They're finishing up processing my sample, and I just learned through their site that they would have given me the kit for free in return for my participation in their lupus study.\n\nIn my opinion, the study seems to be legitimate- one of the advisors is Dr. Daniel Wallace, who shares his office with my rheumatologist, and I hear he has a great reputation.

They put me on macrobid thinking that this was a simple bladder infection...\nOn the morning of day three or four of macrobid I woke up with some pretty bad pain in my left flank. I work in healthcare so I know that this can signify a kidney infection and I know that macrobid isn&amp;#39;t a strong enough medication to knock out a kidney infection so off to the urgent care I go. After another UA the doctor agrees that I should stop the macrobid and instead start a round of Bactrim (a Sulfa containing antibiotic) for 10 days to knock this thing out of the park. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On day nine I wake up with what I think is a weird rash on my chest. It&amp;#39;s kind of splotchy looking with some darker spots. I don&amp;#39;t think much of it and go work my afternoon shift. I figured that it would go away. When I got home I undressed and saw this this rash was EVERYWHERE on my chest, belly, and back. Since I work until late in the evening I waited until the next morning to go to the urgent care. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The doctor there examines this &amp;#39;&amp;#39;rash&amp;#39;&amp;#39; and tells me that this isn&amp;#39;t like anything that he&amp;#39;s seen before (very reassuring) and orders a blood test. About ten minutes later he came back into the exam room and told me that I needed to go to the emergency room ASAP because they found that my platelets were &amp;gt;3000 (for reference they should be between 140,000-500,000) because I was at risk of a serious bleed. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;When I got to the ER they took blood for a confirmatory test and the ER doctor diagnosed me with ITP IIdiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura); a disorder where your autoimmune system confuses your blood platelets as foreign invaders and destroys them. The hematologist that he was collaborating with didn&amp;#39;t think that this was spurred from the Sulfa drug (I had assumed that this was an allergic reaction) that I had been taking and they didn&amp;#39;t know the cause. \nThey prescribed me a megadose of a strong steroid called Decadron (40 mg, 10 4mg pills) for a course of four days. They were just about to send me home after giving me the first dose because I wasn&amp;#39;t showing any signs of bleeding in my mouth. \nLiterally ten minutes after the steroid I felt two strange lumps in my mouth and when my husband looked I had two blood blisters pop up on the inside of my cheek. The doctor ordered a blood type and crossmatch for platelets. I received two units. I was able to go home the same night. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I went to the hematologist the day after I finished the last dose of the steroid and I was having the strangest pain in my pelvis, back, and neck. I attributed it to withdrawing from such a high dose of steroids and when I mentioned these symptoms to the hematologist he ordered a comprehensive ANA panel along with my followup CBC. The good news was that the steroid had worked and my platelets had gone up to 222,000. \nThe bad news was that the ANA panel had come back positive for a few things. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Anti-dsDNA came back at 18 IU/mL with a reference range of (0-9)\nMy anti-sm came back at about 0.4 (this wasn&amp;#39;t marked as being high but most of the other antibodies came back at being 0.2)\nand my RNP came back as being 1.6(?) (I can&amp;#39;t remember the reference range but it was flagged as being high). &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The strangest thing in all of this is that other than the petichiae, low blood platelets, and positive ANA I have no other symptoms. \nWTF. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Has anyone heard of this happening before? \nIf I have lupus, I can live with the diagnosis...But it&amp;#39;s just this limbo that I simply cannot stand. I am going to go to the Rheumatologist on the 29th of this month but I am certain that without 4 of the 11 symptoms that I am going to remain without a \ndiagnosis that would explain that Anti-dsDNA. &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Any thoughts? &lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;TL;DR: Diagnosed with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura (immune system attacking platelets for unknown reason) at the beginning of month; currently in remission from that...But with a positive ANA and Anti-dsDNA with no other symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;",
